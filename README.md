# My first Godot Engine game

For this project, I am creating a simple top-down 'Binding of Isaac' inspired dungeon-crawler where the player has to find the key and escape through the lock door without dying.

This is the asset I am using: https://trevor-pupkin.itch.io/tech-dungeon-roguelite

The objective of this project is far from my ideal game. I am developing this game to first learn how to use the Godot engine, C# coding, and to see what the process of game development might look like.
